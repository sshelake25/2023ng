1. **Enable AOT Compilation**: Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation compiles your Angular components and templates into JavaScript before the web page is served. This results in faster rendering and fewer asynchronous requests. 
   - Use `ng build --prod` for AOT.

2. **Lazy Load Modules**: Use Angular's built-in module system to load parts of your app only when needed. 
   - This reduces the initial bundle size, leading to faster load times.

3. **Use TrackBy with *ngFor**: When using `*ngFor` to loop through items, use `trackBy` to help Angular keep track of items and reduce unnecessary DOM manipulations.
   ```html
   <div *ngFor="let item of items; trackBy: trackByFunction">{{ item.name }}</div>
   ```

4. **Reduce Change Detection**: By default, Angular checks every component for changes. If your app has many components, this can slow it down.
   - Use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in components that don't rely on frequent data updates. This tells Angular to check the component for changes only when its `@Input` properties change.
  
5. **Avoid Computation in Templates**: Ensure that methods or getters in component templates are free of heavy computations. Every time the view is updated, these methods or getters get executed, which can impact performance.
  
6. **Optimize Static Assets**: 
   - Compress images.
   - Use modern formats like WebP.
   - Minify and compress your CSS and JavaScript.
  
7. **Use a Service Worker**: For caching assets and API calls to ensure that the app can function offline and provide faster load times on repeat visits.

8. **Limit Use of Third-Party Libraries**: Only include libraries that are necessary for your project. Extra libraries can bloat your application.
  
9. **Avoid Memory Leaks**: Unsubscribe from Observables when components are destroyed to free up memory.
   ```typescript
   this.subscription.unsubscribe();
   ```

10. **Optimize Animations**: Use Angular's built-in animation features, which utilize the Web Animations API and provide better performance than manual DOM manipulations.

11. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular Universal**: This renders the initial state of your Angular app on the server, which can lead to faster load times and better SEO.

12. **Use CDNs**: Host your Angular libraries and other third-party libraries on Content Delivery Networks (CDN) to improve loading times.

13. **Profile and Audit with DevTools**: Use browser developer tools and the Lighthouse tool to identify bottlenecks and get recommendations for improving performance.

14. **Limit HTTP Calls**: Minimize the number of API calls. Consider batching requests or using GraphQL to fetch only necessary data.

15. **Use Web Workers**: If you have computationally intensive tasks, offload them to web workers to keep the main thread free and ensure the UI remains responsive.

16. **Optimize CSS**: Remove unused styles and avoid deeply nested CSS selectors.

17. **Tree-Shaking**: Ensure tree-shaking is enabled (it usually is with the Angular CLI in production builds) to remove unused code.

18. **Lazy-load Images**: Use techniques or libraries that load images only as they come into the viewport.

By implementing these best practices, you'll be well on your way to optimizing your Angular application for both speed and responsiveness. Always remember to continuously monitor your app's performance, as requirements and user bases evolve.
