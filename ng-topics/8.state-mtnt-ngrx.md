Certainly! NgRx is a framework for building reactive applications in Angular. It provides a set of libraries for managing and interacting with application state in a consistent, predictable manner. At its core, NgRx employs the Redux pattern, which focuses on a single immutable state and pure reducer functions that express the transitions between states.

In the context of an Angular application, let's break down the fundamental aspects of NgRx:

### 1. **Store**: 
This is a single, immutable data structure that represents the state of your entire Angular application. Think of it as a client-side database where all your application's state resides.

### 2. **Actions**:
These are dispatchable event-like payloads that express a desire for a state change. Actions usually have a `type` (to identify the kind of state change) and an optional payload (containing the data associated with that action).

Example:

```typescript
{ type: '[Product Page] Add Product', payload: { productId: 42 } }
```

### 3. **Reducers**:
Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state. They express how the state changes in response to actions.

Example:

```typescript
function productReducer(state = initialState, action: Action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case '[Product Page] Add Product':
      return {...state, products: [...state.products, action.payload]};
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

### 4. **Effects**:
While reducers should remain pure (free of side effects), NgRx provides "effects" to interact or cause side effects. Typically, effects listen for actions, interact with external services or APIs, and dispatch new Actions to the Store. NgRx Effects use RxJS observables, which are integral to Angular.

### 5. **Selectors**:
Selectors are pure functions that take slices of the state for view components. They can compute derived data, allowing Angular components to remain unaware of the overall state structure.

### Benefits of Using NgRx:

1. **Predictable State Management**: By having a single source of truth and using pure functions (reducers) to handle state changes, you can predictably manage and transition between states.
  
2. **Performance**: NgRx can improve performance by allowing more precise change detection strategies in Angular. Since the store's state is immutable, it's easier to track changes.

3. **Powerful Devtools**: The Redux Devtools extension provides powerful tools for inspecting and manipulating application state, making development and debugging faster and more intuitive.

4. **Enhanced Testing Capabilities**: Due to the separation of concerns and the use of pure functions, unit testing becomes more straightforward.

5. **Middleware and Plugins**: NgRx provides a rich ecosystem of middleware (like effects) and plugins that can enhance development, such as logging and router integration.

### When to use NgRx:

It's essential to note that while NgRx provides a robust solution for state management, not every Angular application requires it. If your application has complex state management needs, many user interactions, or non-trivial data flows, NgRx can be a great choice. However, for simple applications, NgRx might introduce unnecessary complexity.

In summary, NgRx provides a structured framework for managing state in Angular applications, making state changes predictable, transparent, and traceable. It works exceptionally well for large applications or applications with complex state management needs.
